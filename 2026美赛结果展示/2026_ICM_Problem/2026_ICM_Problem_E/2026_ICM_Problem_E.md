# Background

Passive solar shading has become a common addition to both housing and commercial buildingsas a part of a retrofit or in new construction. It is relatively inexpensive and creates cost savingsin heating and cooling. The shades are designed to block summer sun from entering a building,while allowing winter sun to not only enter the building but to warm a thermal mass that canreradiate for many hours after. Strategies such as overhangs, vegetative shading, brise-soleilsystems, and high-performance glazing can reduce heat gain in buildings during highertemperatures.

Passive solar shading is different depending on building orientation, window area distributionbetween the different faces of the building, and climate. It also requires the presence of aninternal thermal mass that can be heated by the direct sun. This thermal mass can be concrete,stone, water, or other material that can store heat. The thermal mass not only stores heat butreduces temperature swings throughout the day.

These techniques use the predictable path of the sun (determined through the use of solarposition calculators), materials, geometry, and natural environmental conditions to maintaincomfort and reduce energy consumption. However, the typical calculations make use of the angleof the sun at solar noon on the Summer and Winter Solstices to calculate the optimal extensionof a shade over a window as shown in Figure 1. This is a simplistic view of the problem, andfuture metrics must do better to account for change.

# Scenario

You have been hired by the Collective Organizations Making Astrophysical Protections(COMAP) to innovate the next generation of solar shading strategies to be implemented at thenotional Sungrove University and notional Borealis University.

The notional Sungrove University, located in a warm, low-latitude region with high solarexposure and increasingly frequent heat waves, is planning a major transformation of its mainacademic quad. The campus currently suffers from excessive cooling costs and glare in theclassrooms. The university leadership has decided to pursue a net-zero cooling initiative by2040.

Notably, Sungrove University is planning to retrofit its Academic Hall North. It is a two-storyclassroom and office building. The interior layout combines perimeter offices and classroomswith interior corridors. The building has a rectangular footprint $( 6 0 \mathrm { m } \times 2 4 \mathrm { m } )$ with its long sidealigned east-west as shown in Figure 2. The facade consists of double glazing and a brick veneerwith an average window-to-wall ratio of $45 \%$ on the south facing side and $30 \%$ on the remainingsides. The building relies on mechanical cooling in the summer and hydronic heating in thewinter with limited passive strategies in place. Additional features of this notional building areyours to imagine. Ensure you communicate these features in your writing to COMAP.

Additionally, COMAP has been hired by the notional Borealis University, located at a highlatitude where winter temperatures remain below freezing for months, sunlight hours are limited,and buildings experience heavy heating demands.

Sungrove University and Borealis University are also both planning a new student union that willserve as the hub of university activities. They have each mandated that their new student unionbuilding relies heavily on passive solar shading rather than mechanical cooling systems. TheUniversities want their student union building to serve as a prototype for future developments,meaning that their passive solar strategy design must perform well not only today, but underprojected climate conditions well into the future.

Beyond the standard approach to shading as outlined in the Background, to assist these notionaluniversities, you should extend your ideas to include:

− Shading needs throughout the day rather than just at solar noon.

− Windows of different sizes and shapes.

− Windows that do not face exactly south/north (depending on the hemisphere).

− Shades of different styles and materials that would match the architecture of the building.

As with any new strategy or model, you will not only need to describe your approach but alsoexplain the advantages that your proposal holds over the previous standard. COMAP needs toknow how your passive solar shading strategies can more effectively reduce heat gain in campusbuildings during the summer while still admitting beneficial winter sun.

# Requirements

Your team has been asked by COMAP to provide a model-based feasibility analysis thatdetermines how Sungrove University can reduce its academic year cooling load with passivesolar design in the retrofit of buildings on campus. To do so, design a retrofit for SungroveUniversity’s Academic Hall North that optimizes heating and cooling throughout the academicyear. What passive solar strategies and building features would you use, and how would youevaluate their performance?

Borealis University has a building with a similar design to Sungrove University’s Academic HallNorth. How can extending your work for Sungrove University to include the crucial importanceof the effective use of a thermal mass provide Borealis University with a plan to use passive solarshading? You may want to consider building geometry, material selection, glazing positioning,internal thermal mass, or other aspects to maximize winter heat gain while avoiding overheatingin the warmer months.

The retrofit design models at both Sungrove and Borealis Universities are helpful for only thosenotional sites. Adapt your model and discuss the design considerations for other locationsincluding the different heating and cooling needs at places that might have similar latitudes.

Design a passive solar shading strategy for the new student union building at either SungroveUniversity or Borealis University that keeps the building temperate. Describe the strategies,building features, and modeling approaches you would use to evaluate performance over time.

You may wish to address some of the following in your analysis:

Predicting solar heat gain

Estimating heating and/or cooling load reductions

- Accounting for seasonal variations

- Evaluating the tradeoffs between daylighting needs and shading effectiveness

# Glossary

Solar noon is the moment during the day when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky for agiven location.

Winter Solstice is the day with the least daylight of the year, caused by Earth’s tilt.

Summer Solstice is the day with the most daylight of the year, caused by Earth’s tilt.

Notional means theoretical or fictitious. The universities in this problem are not real, but onlytheoretical case studies.

Net‑zero cooling means providing cooling without adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
