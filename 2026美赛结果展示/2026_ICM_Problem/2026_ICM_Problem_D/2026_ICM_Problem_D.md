# 2026 ICMProblem D: Managing Sports for Success

“The player's job is to help his team win.” - Cliff Blau, baseball historian and statistician“The player’s job is to make money for the owner.” – all sports team owners

Fans tend to focus on the players on the field or court, but that is only the tip of the sportsbusiness iceberg. Sports are entertainment first and foremost. Entertainment is a profit-generating business and the players are hired mostly for that purpose. Often, fans of spectatorsports ignore the financial purpose of a sport and try to focus on the game itself and itsparticipants. However, in professional sports business, the primary goal is to make money for theowner and not necessarily win games. While these two goals may be related, since winninggenerates more interest in the team, other factors are involved. And for some sports teams, thereare crucial moments when opportunity and risk are both high – like this year’s situation for teamsin the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the most prominent women’sprofessional basketball league in the United States. For many reasons (especially higher faninterest), WNBA teams are hoping to evolve from risky startup businesses into majorentertainment enterprises by taking advantage of increased media attention, new team franchises,larger venues, and a new digital platform to increase revenue. The owners in that league need touse sports analytics to succeed on the court but also use financial modeling to achieve significantfinancial gain in the bottom line of their business’s profit sheet.

Should players (and other employees of the team business) in a sport get paid more for theirperformance that produces wins or for their contributions in turning a profit for the team owner?Sometimes, a player’s sport performance is directly related to profit, but not always. Someplayers may attract fans based more on popularity than performance. These players may generateticket, parking, concession, and jersey revenue much more than players with higher levels ofperformance. Financial and sports analytics models need to connect to create good team decisionmaking.

In the emerging field of sports analytics with various kinds and amounts of performance data,there continue to be challenges to build statistics that quantify the value of player talents andperformances (what statistic to measure, how to measure it, when to measure it). Some playersare injured more frequently than others. How does that affect player value? Some havepersonalities that lead to more popularity and appeal that lead to financial gain. Context andtiming matter in the sense that some players, even those with average performance, comethrough at important moments of the game or critical times in the season. There is a temporalelement that must consider the measure of future potential of a player/employee on achieving thegoal of the team. Some roles may be performance or skill-based and other roles are accomplishedmore by hard work and perseverance.

The player or team perceptions, popularity, timing, and marketing can play major roles, inaddition to the location of the team. Teams in large markets often have different sports situationsand goals than small-market teams. Those differences impact how owners achieve profit andrecruit their players and employees. Can modeling help an owner establish methodologies forsetting offers, negotiating, and writing contracts?

There are many team issues that are strictly or mostly financial, just as there are issues that aremostly sports. In many cases, professional sports teams are franchises that are part of the leagueenterprise and often operate with additional rules and constraints set by leagues or governmentson their player salaries and contracts. These are intended to make the game competition fair withsome reasonable amount of competitive balance. Some professional sports have systems thatregulate salaries with caps or taxes. Every season, the owner must decide how much to financewith debt versus equity and whether risks in the form of seeking better team performance withassociated additional costs are worth taking. In the sports business world, conditions such asrevenues, salaries, injuries, trade opportunities, taxes, fees, and interest rates change over time.Sports teams are now seen as premium assets, with values in many sports soaring far beyondhistorical norms due to financial and market factors such as lucrative media deals andaccumulation of vast data streams and intellectual property.

As a modeling group for a sports team, your ICM team can use publicly available sport andfinance data for a team of your choice (the team you select must consist of at least 5 players thatplay cooperatively at the same time and be a member of a professional league) and build abusiness and management model for the team for the coming or next season.

As was mentioned earlier as an example of how this modeling work can be extremely valuable,the WNBA is undergoing significant financial changes -- record viewership, rising franchisevalues, and significant player benefit expectations. Currently, negotiations and demands over therevenue-sharing agreement between teams and players are sticking points. During this comingseason, team owners have an opportunity to remake and improve their business or succumb torisks that may cause them to sell or take on substantial debt. These issues create a situation wheresolid financial and sport modeling can make a big difference for the current and future owners ofthese teams. You may use a WNBA team if you care to, but you are not required to do that.

# Questions to consider:

Design a dynamic decision-making model that would help your team owner and generalmanagers adjust their leverage in response to changing team performance and economicconditions. The goal is to maximize team profit and value while managing team structure andperformance. The model should include priorities and actions for the management teams in bothbusiness operations and team operations, and account for systems that will help the owner makedecisions through the coming season and beyond.

Based on the needs of the team and your model, develop a strategy to acquire players for nextseason using the standard practice for your team’s league such as a draft, free agency, trades,transfer fees, or other standard practices. You may want to consider how to value a player or the

team dynamics in terms of the profit for the team owners. Using the outcomes of your model,discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your strategy on the business.

There are many league-determined rulings that impact how a single team can operate, such assalary caps, number of players on a roster, schedule (number, order, location, and date of gamesin a season, so consequently days of rest), media contracts and rights, revenue distributions, andothers. If a league is expanding the number of franchises (such as for WNBA), it is likely toimpact all teams in the league. Use your model to decide how your team’s strategy shouldchange from your initial strategy during a season with league expansion. How does the locationfor the new team impact your model and resulting strategy? Be clear on the impact on the teamowners and locations for the new team that would be particularly harmful or beneficial under anexpansion.

Consider one additional business decision and use your model to design the best strategy foryour team. Some examples include but are not limited to:

Ticket sales vary greatly by the size of the stadium, time of year, popularity of the team(yours and opponent), size of the team’s market, and other factors. A team may choose tomaximize ticket sale revenue for each game or lower the prices to have larger attendancewith the possibility to convert some of those attendees into season ticket holders. Howdo you determine the optimal ticket pricing strategy over a season?

The venue for the team to play its games may be rented or owned with the need tomaintain, renovate, or even build a new venue. How do you balance the long-term costof the venue when it is a short-term decision?

Player equity in ownership can be one strategy for subsidizing large salaries, such asrevenue sharing (single season), profit participation (bonus), decision makers (as part ofunions or collective bargaining), long-term equity stake (part owner), or other methods.Player equity options need to be sufficiently lucrative for a player to accept it, but notundermine the future funding options. How do you determine which players, if any, areoffered equity and how much?

Media deals are a large source of revenue, fan engagement, and brand building, oftenproducing high engagement and advertising potential. While leagues usually contractnational deals, teams can sometimes broker their own local deals or streaming options.Does your team need to improve or change its media presence?

Division or conference structure, which can build or take advantage of rivalries whererival teams play more often, is generally determined by the league. Are there ways thatleague structures and schedules be reconfigured to increase profit for your team?

• Determine your own issue that applies to your team or sport and use your model to helpdecide the issue to improve team performance or owner profit.

How does your model help management adjust when a key player is injured?
